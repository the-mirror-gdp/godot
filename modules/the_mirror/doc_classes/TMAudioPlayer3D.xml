		The Mirror wrapper class for Godot's [AudioStreamPlayer3D] node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		TMAudioPlayer3D supplies additional functionality over Godot's [AudioStreamPlayer3D] node. Specifically:
		- This node can play audio either spatially (3D) or globally (0D).
		- This node can loop any audio stream (must provide a non-looping [AudioStream]).
		- This node can set the volume of the audio stream in a linear percentage (on a range of 0.0 to 100.0).

			<description>
				Sets the audio stream, and plays it if [member AudioStreamPlayer3D.autoplay] is enabled. The audio stream should not be looped.

	<members>
		<member name="base_volume_percentage" type="float" setter="set_base_volume_percentage" getter="get_base_volume_percentage" default="100.0">
			The volume, measured in a linear percentage. This is a wrapper around [member AudioStreamPlayer3D.volume_db]. For spatial audio, this is the volume when 10 meters away from the audio player.
		</member>
		<member name="is_spatial" type="bool" setter="set_is_spatial" getter="get_is_spatial" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], this node plays audio in 3D space, using the range and max volume settings, and being directional.
			If [code]false[/code], this node plays audio globally. The range and max volume settings will be ignored, and the audio will be directionless.
		</member>
		<member name="loop_audio" type="bool" setter="set_loop_audio" getter="get_loop_audio" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], this node will loop the audio it is playing. This setting only works when the [AudioStream] is not set to loop.
		</member>
		<member name="spatial_max_volume_percentage" type="float" setter="set_spatial_max_volume_percentage" getter="get_spatial_max_volume_percentage" default="150.0">
			When [member is_spatial] is true, this is the maximum volume the audio is allowed to get. This is a wrapper around [member AudioStreamPlayer3D.max_db], but will preserve the setting regardless of the current state of [member is_spatial].
		</member>
		<member name="spatial_range" type="float" setter="set_spatial_range" getter="get_spatial_range" default="0.0">
			When [member is_spatial] is true, the audio can be heard within this range. The range is measured in meters. This is a wrapper around [member AudioStreamPlayer3D.max_distance], but will preserve the setting regardless of the current state of [member is_spatial].
