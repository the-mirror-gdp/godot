	<brief_description>
		A 3D compound shape used for physics collision.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A compound shape made out of other 3D shapes. The shapes in the compound shape may be any other [JShape3D], including other JCompoundShape3D shapes.
		If the compound shape contains a [JMeshShape3D], it is concave and may only be used on static objects. Shapes may not be changed after the compound shape is generated.
